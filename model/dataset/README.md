# JSON to TXT Converter for Labelme Annotations

This script converts JSON files created with [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) into TXT files. The output format is suitable for use in various machine learning tasks, such as object detection (e.g. YOLO), where annotations need to be in text format.

## Features

- Parses JSON files from Labelme annotations.
- Converts and saves annotations in a TXT format.
- Outputs the class labels to a separate `classes.txt` file.
- Handles multiple JSON files in a directory.
